    "### INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### AIM : The main aim of the research paper “Classifying YouTube Comments Based on Sentiment and Type of Sentence” is to go beyond basic positive - negative sentiment analysis and create a model that can classify YouTube comments into six categories: Positive, Negative, Interrogative, Imperative, Corrective, and Miscellaneous. By combining both sentiment polarity (positive or negative feeling) and sentence intention (such as asking a question or giving a command), the research seeks to provide a deeper understanding of user comments. The study applies text preprocessing, feature extraction (Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF), and several machine learning models to achieve accurate classification, with the larger goal of improving automated comment analysis on online platforms.\n",

    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER: \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper “Classifying YouTube Comments Based on Sentiment and Type of Sentence” presents a machine learning approach to categorize YouTube comments into six classes: Positive, Negative, Interrogative, Imperative, Corrective, and Miscellaneous. The authors argue that traditional sentiment analysis, which only identifies comments as positive or negative, is not sufficient for understanding the full meaning of online interactions. To address this, the paper combines both sentiment polarity and sentence type classification to provide a more detailed view of user opinions and intentions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in the study consists of pre-labeled YouTube comments. The comments go through a series of preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, removal of URLs and emojis, stopword filtering (while keeping important words like “not” and question words), spelling correction, and lemmatization. Features are extracted using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectorizers. Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that Logistic Regression and Linear SVM performed the best, achieving high accuracy and F1-scores. The paper concludes that combining sentiment and sentence type leads to more meaningful insights into online comments, which can be applied in areas such as comment moderation, opinion mining, and understanding user engagement on social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube receives millions of comments every day, but these comments are often noisy, unstructured, and hard to analyze. Traditional sentiment analysis only classifies text as positive or negative, which does not fully capture the meaning or intention behind a comment. For example, a user might ask a question, give a command, or correct someone, these types of comments cannot be understood by simple sentiment analysis. This lack of detailed classification makes it difficult for platforms to effectively monitor user interactions, improve content moderation, and understand audience behavior. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can automatically classify YouTube comments not just by sentiment, but also by the type of sentence, to provide deeper and more useful insights.\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms like YouTube generate a massive amount of user comments every day. These comments reflect opinions, emotions, questions, and feedback from millions of users worldwide. While they are a valuable source of information, the unstructured and informal nature of comments, often filled with slang, abbreviations, and grammatical errors, makes them difficult to analyze automatically. Existing sentiment analysis methods usually focus only on identifying whether a comment is positive or negative. However, this approach misses important details such as whether the comment is a question, a command, or a correction. Without capturing both the sentiment and the intention, organizations and researchers cannot fully understand user engagement or design effective moderation tools. This creates the need for a more advanced classification system that can handle both aspects together, leading to better insights into online discussions.\n",

    "# Parameters to perform the Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Packages Installation:**\n",
    "   - `!pip install autocorrect`: Installs the \"autocorrect\" package for text correction.\n",
    "   - `!pip install nltk`: Installs the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Importing Libraries:**\n",
    "   - Several libraries are imported to assist with data manipulation, analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importing Data:**\n",
    "   - The code reads a CSV file named \"final_data.csv\" using pandas and stores it in a DataFrame called `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   - The unique categories in the second column (index 1) of the DataFrame are printed.\n",

    "6. **Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "   - A bag-of-words representation is created for the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "   - Words that occur more than a certain threshold (`N_occurance`) are considered as features.\n",
    "   - The occurrence of each feature in each document is recorded in a matrix named `evaluation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Feature Scaling:**\n",
    "   - The `evaluation` matrix is normalized using Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Cross-validation is performed (5-fold) to evaluate model performance using the accuracy metric.\n",
    "   - The results are stored in a DataFrame named `cv_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Model Performance Visualization:**\n",
    "   - Box plots and strip plots are created to visualize the distribution of accuracy scores across different models.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- This shows that for sparse, high-dimensional text data, linear models (LR, SVC) often remain stronger baselines than a shallow neural network.\n",

    "### Conclusion and Future Direction :\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Learnings : \n",
    "- Learned how to preprocess noisy text data (remove URLs, emojis, stopwords, lemmatization).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood the importance of feature engineering (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observed that linear models (LogReg, SVC) often outperform more complex models on sparse text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gained experience adding a new model (MLP) as a project contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understood the role of accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices in evaluating models.\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Results Discussion :\n",
    "\n",
    " - Logistic Regression ( 0.8585) gave the best results, confirming the strength of linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear SVC ( 0.856) performed closely, also proving effective for sparse features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multinomial NB (0.8505) and Random Forest ( 0.8345) were competitive but did not surpass LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree (0.809) performed the weakest due to overfitting on sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MLP Classifier (0.826), added as our contribution, outperformed Decision Tree but did not beat LR or SVC. This shows neural networks need careful tuning or richer features (like TF-IDF with n-grams) to compete with strong baselines.\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Limitations :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing could be improved\n",
    "- Class imbalance\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning was minimal for some models\n",
    "\n",
    "*******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### Future Extension :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Apply class balancing techniques\n",
    "- Test the trained models on comments from other platforms\n",
    "- Build a simple application or API to classify YouTube comments in real time."
